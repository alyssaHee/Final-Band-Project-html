        My favourite performance was the 2023 wind ensemble festival
        performance. I think our band really came together that year and our
        Symphonic Songs for Band “air band” rehearsal before the performance
        made it really special. I felt like we were all united and focused that
        hour and the performance felt amazing. I was very proud of us and I
        remember students from Maples Collegiate sitting in the first few rows
        taking notes on our playing and that made me more proud.
        <br /><br />My second favourite performance would have to be the last
        concert where we played Symphonic Dance no.3 ‘Fiesta’. I’ve never
        heard/felt the symphonic band sound so together and strong; the
        performance was like magic.
